# JarSense
Good addition to finish off CI/D for plugin development

##Purpose
This plugin was made as a final step for my travis ci pipeline.
[Commit->Build->Test->Deploy->Refresh]

What this achieves is quite simple. As soon as a jar is edited/and or added in the directory(on server)
you specify, a 'refresh' command that you also specify is executed so you may use/test your latest build. 

##Usage
Very simple(only two configuration options). The first is to specify the refresh
command you'd like the server to execute, and the second is to tell the plugin where
to listen for incoming jars. 

##Download
